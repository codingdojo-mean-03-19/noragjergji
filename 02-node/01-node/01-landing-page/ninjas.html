        <h2>Fun Fact about ninjas!</h2>
        <h4>Although ninjas used an assortment of weapons and tools, one of their most important items was a live cricket, which was used to aid them in their covert missions. Crickets would be induced to chirp, with the use of a special mix of chemicals. The chirping of crickets would cleverly mask the footsteps of a ninja, so they could maneuver undetected.</h4>
